## Philosophy: Compounding Engineering

**Each unit of engineering work should make subsequent units of work easier—not harder.**

When working on this repository, follow the compounding engineering process:

1. **Plan** → Understand the change needed and its impact
2. **Delegate** → Use AI tools to help with implementation
3. **Assess** → Verify changes work as expected
4. **Codify** → Update this CLAUDE.md with learnings

## Working with This Repository

### Adding a New Plugin

1. Create plugin directory: `plugins/new-plugin-name/`
2. Add plugin structure:
   ```
   plugins/new-plugin-name/
   ├── .claude-plugin/plugin.json
   ├── agents/
   ├── commands/
   └── README.md
   ```
3. Update `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` to include the new plugin
4. Test locally before committing

### Updating the Compounding Engineering Plugin

When agents, commands, or skills are added/removed, follow this checklist:

#### 1. Count all components accurately

```bash
# Count agents
ls plugins/compound-engineering/agents/*.md | wc -l

# Count commands
ls plugins/compound-engineering/commands/*.md | wc -l

# Count skills
ls -d plugins/compound-engineering/skills/*/ 2>/dev/null | wc -l
```

#### 2. Update ALL description strings with correct counts

The description appears in multiple places and must match everywhere:

- [ ] `plugins/compound-engineering/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` → `description` field
- [ ] `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` → plugin `description` field
- [ ] `plugins/compound-engineering/README.md` → intro paragraph

Format: `"Includes X specialized agents, Y commands, and Z skill(s)."`

#### 3. Update version numbers

When adding new functionality, bump the version in:

- [ ] `plugins/compound-engineering/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` → `version`
- [ ] `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` → plugin `version`

#### 4. Update documentation

- [ ] `plugins/compound-engineering/README.md` → list all components
- [ ] `plugins/compound-engineering/CHANGELOG.md` → document changes
- [ ] `CLAUDE.md` → update structure diagram if needed


#### 5. Validate JSON files

```bash
cat .claude-plugin/marketplace.json | jq .
cat plugins/compound-engineering/.claude-plugin/plugin.json | jq .
```

#### 6. Verify before committing

```bash
# Ensure counts in descriptions match actual files
grep -o "Includes [0-9]* specialized agents" plugins/compound-engineering/.claude-plugin/plugin.json
ls plugins/compound-engineering/agents/*.md | wc -l
```

### Marketplace.json Structure

The marketplace.json follows the official Claude Code spec:

```json
{
  "name": "marketplace-identifier",
  "owner": {
    "name": "Owner Name",
    "url": "https://github.com/owner"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "description": "Marketplace description",
    "version": "1.0.0"
  },
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "plugin-name",
      "description": "Plugin description",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "author": { ... },
      "homepage": "https://...",
      "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
      "source": "./plugins/plugin-name"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Only include fields that are in the official spec.** Do not add custom fields like:

- `downloads`, `stars`, `rating` (display-only)
- `categories`, `featured_plugins`, `trending` (not in spec)
- `type`, `verified`, `featured` (not in spec)

### Plugin.json Structure

Each plugin has its own plugin.json with detailed metadata:

```json
{
  "name": "plugin-name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Plugin description",
  "author": { ... },
  "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2"],
  "components": {
    "agents": 15,
    "commands": 6,
    "hooks": 2
  },
  "agents": {
    "category": [
      {
        "name": "agent-name",
        "description": "Agent description",
        "use_cases": ["use-case-1", "use-case-2"]
      }
    ]
  },
  "commands": {
    "category": ["command1", "command2"]
  }
}
```


## Testing Changes

### Test Locally

1. Install the marketplace locally:

   ```bash
   claude /plugin marketplace add /Users/yourusername/claude-plugins
   ```

2. Install the plugin:

   ```bash
   claude /plugin install compound-engineering
   ```

3. Test agents and commands:
   ```bash
   claude /review
   claude agent reviewer "test message"
   ```

### Validate JSON

Before committing, ensure JSON files are valid:

```bash
cat .claude-plugin/marketplace.json | jq .
cat plugins/compound-engineering/.claude-plugin/plugin.json | jq .
```

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Agent

1. Create `plugins/compound-engineering/agents/new-agent.md`
2. Update plugin.json agent count and agent list
3. Update README.md agent list
4. Test with `claude agent new-agent "test"`

### Adding a New Command

1. Create `plugins/compound-engineering/commands/new-command.md`
2. Update plugin.json command count and command list
3. Update README.md command list
4. Test with `claude /new-command`

### Adding a New Skill

1. Create skill directory: `plugins/compound-engineering/skills/skill-name/`
2. Add skill structure:
   ```
   skills/skill-name/
   ├── SKILL.md           # Skill definition with frontmatter (name, description)
   └── scripts/           # Supporting scripts (optional)
   ```
3. Update plugin.json description with new skill count
4. Update marketplace.json description with new skill count
5. Update README.md with skill documentation
6. Update CHANGELOG.md with the addition
7. Test with `claude skill skill-name`

**Skill file format (SKILL.md):**
```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: Brief description of what the skill does
---

# Skill Title

Detailed documentation...
```

### Updating Tags/Keywords

Tags should reflect the compounding engineering philosophy:

- Use: `ai-powered`, `compound-engineering`, `workflow-automation`, `knowledge-management`
- Avoid: Framework-specific tags unless the plugin is framework-specific

## Commit Conventions

Follow these patterns for commit messages:

- `Add [agent/command name]` - Adding new functionality
- `Remove [agent/command name]` - Removing functionality
- `Update [file] to [what changed]` - Updating existing files
- `Fix [issue]` - Bug fixes
- `Simplify [component] to [improvement]` - Refactoring

## Key Learnings

_This section captures important learnings as we work on this repository._

### 2024-11-22: Added gemini-imagegen skill and fixed component counts

Added the first skill to the plugin and discovered the component counts were wrong (said 15 agents, actually had 17). Created a comprehensive checklist for updating the plugin to prevent this in the future.

**Learning:** Always count actual files before updating descriptions. The counts appear in multiple places (plugin.json, marketplace.json, README.md) and must all match. Use the verification commands in the checklist above.

### 2024-10-09: Simplified marketplace.json to match official spec

The initial marketplace.json included many custom fields (downloads, stars, rating, categories, trending) that aren't part of the Claude Code specification. We simplified to only include:

- Required: `name`, `owner`, `plugins`
- Optional: `metadata` (with description and version)
- Plugin entries: `name`, `description`, `version`, `author`, `homepage`, `tags`, `source`

**Learning:** Stick to the official spec. Custom fields may confuse users or break compatibility with future versions.
